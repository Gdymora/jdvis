Utility functions for common tasks

Plugin System
ModernDOM features a powerful plugin system that allows developers to extend its functionality easily. Plugins can add new methods to the ModernDOM prototype, enhancing the library's capabilities without modifying the core code.
Creating Plugins
To create a plugin for ModernDOM, developers can use the following pattern:

```javascript
(function (global) {
  function initPlugin($) {
    if (typeof $ === "undefined") {
      console.error("ModernDOM is not defined");
      return;
    }

    $.prototype.newMethod = function () {
      // Plugin functionality here
    };

    console.log("Plugin loaded successfully");
  }

  function waitForDependencies() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      function check() {
        if (typeof global.$ !== "undefined") {
          resolve();
        } else {
          setTimeout(check, 50);
        }
      }
      check();
    });
  }

  function init() {
    waitForDependencies()
      .then(() => {
        initPlugin(global.$);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error initializing plugin:", error);
      });
  }

  if (document.readyState === "loading") {
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", init);
  } else {
    init();
  }
})(typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : this);
```

This pattern ensures that the plugin is initialized only when ModernDOM is available, making it safe to use in various loading scenarios.
Examples of Plugins
ModernDOM supports a wide range of plugins, including but not limited to:

Form Validation: Add custom form validation functionality.
Rich Text Editors: Integrate WYSIWYG editors like CKEditor.
Data Visualization: Create charts and graphs using library data.
Infinite Scrolling: Implement endless scrolling for content lists.
Image Galleries: Build responsive image galleries and sliders.
Date Pickers: Add customizable date selection widgets.

Benefits of the Plugin System

Modularity: Developers can add only the functionality they need.
Maintainability: Plugins can be updated independently of the core library.
Customization: Easy to tailor ModernDOM to specific project requirements.

Conclusion
ModernDOM combines the ease of use reminiscent of jQuery with modern JavaScript practices, providing a powerful yet lightweight solution for DOM manipulation and web development. Its plugin system offers unlimited potential for extension, making it a versatile choice for projects of all sizes.
